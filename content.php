            Rainless will tell you how many times it has rained on a 
            particular date and location during the past years. 
            The idea is to facilitate planning for future daily events, 
            such as barbecues, for which precipitation is not desired. 
            Weather forecasts usually only cover the upcoming two weeks 
            hence planning for longer into the future is sometimes hard. 
            I hope to help you somewhat with this planning since this app 
            is based on precipitation history.
